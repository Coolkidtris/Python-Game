In a circular room, you find yourself to be \n facing the back of an uncertain fellow. Scattered around the room are items of various use. The room has no natural \n light, with a chandelier providing all brightness whilst being hung from a rusted old chain, thickened with years of \n neglect. You draw your weapon of choice, and with your breathing steadily increasing, you bellow out 'Who's there? \n The figure turns and smiles. Without warning, they run at you, their feet emitting no sound as they glide across the \n worn carpet, slowly loosing its color. It looks like you're in for a fight.'\n \n "}
